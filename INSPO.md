## inspo sites
the site below helped me to design and plan out my website

# spca
the spca website helped me to plan out my site for a few reasons, mainly because the site has the same purpose as my site, so i know it does the same job, and i wanted to follow that formula, also the color scheme is light and gentle without being to boring or over the top, the use of white space is nice as well as it isn't overpowering or too little. the calm colors were the main thing i wanted to take from this site but i did like the header/nav bar, as its basic yet has everything you need, sadly i didnt fully get round to getting it done 100%, tho i was able to take some inspiration from it none the less.

# petfinder 
pet finder helped me to design my site as it also because of the way colors are used, the dark on the light was nice and i did the same with my site (tried to at least),  also the gallery where they display all the animals is great so i begun to pull that into my site, via the adopt page, i couldn't figure out how to display info over the images nicely however, so i stuck with the images on their own.

# pet refuge
my last site for inspo was pet reuge, for the main reason that it had counters on it, for pets adopted and nights they ahve been adopted, which i thought was a really cool idea, and with the donate page that i didnt complete i was thinking of using the doantion system they use, which is a small display that can be cahnged between monthly and one time, then pulling you into a form to fill out to pay.
