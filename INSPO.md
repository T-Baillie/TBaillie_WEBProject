## inspo sites
the site below helped me to design and plan out my website

# spca
the spca website helped me to plan out my site for a few reasons, mainly because the site has the same purpose as my site, so i know it does the same job, and i wanted to follow that formula, also the color scheme is light and gentle without being to boring or over the top, the use of white space is nice as well as it isn't overpowering or too little.

# petfinder 
pet finder helped me to design my site as it also because of the way colors are used, the dark on the light was nice and i did the same with my site (tried to at least),  also the gallery where they display all the animals is great so i begun to pull that into my site, via the adopt page, i couldn't figure out how to display info over the images nicely however, so i stuck with the images on their own.
