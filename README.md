  - main page responsiveness isn't done
  - footer border goes across whole screen

## Links for inspiration 
### Awwwards.com
[awwwards.com](https://www.awwwards.com/) because of white space use, and nav bar.
### petfinder.com
https://www.petfinder.com/ as its based on the same idea as my site. this site is helping me to design my adoption page, as i like how its laid out and easy to use, 
### spca.com
https://www.spca.nz/centre/dunedin-centre as its also based on same idea. i have also tried to take the blue color scheme from this site, as its easy on the eyes and calm, 
i didn't want to go for anything overly bright or intense as this site isn't fast-paced or over the top with anything.
