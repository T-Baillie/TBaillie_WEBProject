## Links for inspiration 
### Awwwards.com
[awwwards.com](https://www.awwwards.com/) because of white space use, and nav bar.
### petfinder.com
https://www.petfinder.com/ as its based on the same idea as my site. this site is helping me to design my adpotion page, as i like how its laid out and easy to use, 
### spca.com
https://www.spca.nz/centre/dunedin-centre as its also based on same idea. i have aslo tried to take the blue colour scheme from this site, as its easy on the eyes and calm, 
i didnt want to go for anything overly bright or intense as this site isnt fast-paced or over the top with anything.
