# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
npm run build
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

## Websites ideas and help
website README:
```
website idea, photography website photo gallery + services and costs
based on SK photography
site based on Adpotion/adopting pets.
websites to take inspo from 
```
[awwwards.com](https://www.awwwards.com/) because of white space use, and nav bar.
https://www.petfinder.com/ as its based on the same idea as my site.
https://www.spca.nz/centre/dunedin-centre as its also based on same idea.
```
## Extra Stuff

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
